## Q & A

#### Why Frontend Mentor? Couldn't you have just looked up the solution?

This was brought to my attention so I'm addressing it here (I didn't do that btw). Here are my reasons:

1. This was my first serious HTML, CSS, and Javascript project. I really didn't have a grasp of what would be an appopriate challenge for me. I could've recreated a live site from somewhere or searched up designs on dribbble, behance, or awwwards to create but I didn't know if it would be too hard to too easy and I would've ended up wasting my time. With this, I knew it would be an adequate test of my skills because someone more experienced than me knew so.
2. It allowed me to follow an actual profressional workflow (or close enough).
3. You can see my commit history and how I did actually learn things the hard way by making mistakes like setting hard height's when not needed (which caused horizontal scroll bars when making it responsive). See the [commit here](https://github.com/rbhogal/bookmark-landing-page/commit/bbf16a8eac7af0f3836c6f407ba98450c04028a8#diff-b3b145d502f30859c28e06006a2b44428dd62a3fe4fc5b9db66c319a75eab732L325), notice how to fix my mistake for this subtext container, I set a max-width instead of width, and commented out the height. 
4. I've also created a website that was more of an "original" project you can check out [here](https://github.com/rbhogal/burgerlords-recreation)
